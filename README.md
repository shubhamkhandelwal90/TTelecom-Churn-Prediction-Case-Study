# Telecom-Churn-Prediction-Case-Study
It is a Telecom Churn Prediction Case Study to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc. It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
